**An ultra-lightweight, pure-Rust Prompt Firewall that executes local intelligence, slashes LLM costs, and accelerates agentic workloads.**

---

Standard API gateways are "dumb pipes" — they blindly forward every prompt to cloud LLMs regardless of complexity. Agent loops repeat identical prompts. Simple tasks burn the same expensive tokens as complex reasoning. The result: runaway costs, high latency, and sensitive data leaving your perimeter.

Isartor replaces the dumb pipe with **algorithmic intelligence at the edge**. Acting as a drop-in OpenAI replacement, it intercepts prompts and applies a cascade of local algorithms — from deterministic hashing to pure-Rust neural networks — to resolve requests locally before they ever reach the cloud.

## The Deflection Stack

Every incoming request passes through a sequence of smart computing layers. Only prompts requiring genuine, complex reasoning survive the stack to reach the cloud.

```

| Layer | What It Does | Typical Latency |
|:------|:-------------|:----------------|
| **L1a — Exact Cache** | Sub-millisecond duplicate detection via fast hashing. Traps infinite agent loops instantly. | < 1 ms |
| **L1b — Semantic Cache** | Catches meaning-equivalent prompts ("Price?" ≈ "Cost?") using pure-Rust embeddings. | 1–5 ms |
| **L2 — SLM Router** | Triages intent with an embedded Small Language Model to resolve simple tasks locally. | 50–200 ms |
| **L2.5 — Context Optimiser** | Retrieves and reranks documents to minimise token usage before the cloud call. | 5–50 ms |
| **L3 — Cloud Logic** | Routes surviving complex prompts to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure with fallback resilience. | Network-bound |

Layers 1a and 1b deflect **71% of repetitive agentic traffic** and **38% of diverse task traffic** before any neural inference runs.

## How It Works

Getting started with Isartor takes three steps:

### 1. Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isartor-ai/Isartor/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or use Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/isartor-ai/isartor:latest
```

### 2. Connect

Point any OpenAI-compatible client at Isartor — just change the base URL:

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1",
    api_key="your-api-key",
)
```

Works with the official SDKs, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, GitHub Copilot CLI, and any other OpenAI-compatible tool.

### 3. Save

Isartor deflects repetitive and simple prompts locally. You keep the same responses, pay for fewer tokens, and get lower latency — with zero code changes beyond the URL.
