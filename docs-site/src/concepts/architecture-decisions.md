# Architecture Decision Records

> **Key design decisions, trade-offs, and rationale behind Isartor's architecture.**

Each ADR follows a lightweight format: Context → Decision → Consequences.

Maintenance policy: when an implementation changes Isartor's lasting system structure, request flow, API surfaces, routing strategy, cache behavior, deployment model, or other architectural trade-offs, update this ADR page in the same change. If that implementation also changes user-visible capabilities, keep the feature list in `README.md`, supplementary docs in `docs/`, and published docs in `docs-site/src/` aligned as part of the same ticket.

## ADR-001: Multi-Layer Deflection Stack Architecture

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

AI Prompt Firewall traffic follows a power-law distribution: the majority of prompts are simple or repetitive, while only a small fraction requires expensive cloud LLMs. Sending all traffic to a single provider wastes tokens and money.

### Decision

Implement a **sequential Deflection Stack** with 4+ layers, each capable of short-circuiting:

- **Layer 0** — Operational defense (auth, rate limiting, concurrency control)
- **Layer 1** — Semantic + exact cache (zero-cost hits)
- **Layer 2** — Local SLM triage (classify intent, execute simple tasks locally)
- **Layer 2.5** — Context optimiser (retrieve + rerank to minimise token usage)
- **Layer 3** — Cloud LLM fallback (only the hardest prompts)

**Layer 2.5 (Context Optimiser):**
Retrieves and reranks candidate documents or responses to minimize downstream token usage. Typically implements top-K selection, reranking, or context window optimization before forwarding to the LLM. Instrumented as the `context_optimise` span in observability.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** 60–80% of traffic can be resolved before Layer 3, dramatically reducing cost.
- **Positive:** Each layer adds latency only when needed — cache hits are sub-millisecond.
- **Positive:** Clear separation of concerns; each layer is independently testable.
- **Negative:** Deflection Stack adds conceptual complexity vs. a simple reverse proxy.
- **Negative:** Each layer needs its own error handling and timeout strategy.

## ADR-002: Axum + Tokio as Runtime Foundation

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

The firewall must handle high concurrency (thousands of simultaneous connections) with low latency overhead. The binary should be small, statically linked, and deployable to minimal environments.

### Decision

Use **Axum 0.8** on **Tokio 1.x** for the async HTTP server. Build with `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `opt-level = "z"` + LTO for a ~5 MB static binary.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Tokio's work-stealing scheduler handles 10K+ concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Positive:** Axum's type-safe extractors catch errors at compile time.
- **Positive:** Static musl binary runs in distroless containers (no libc, no shell).
- **Negative:** Rust's compilation times are longer than Go/Node.js equivalents.
- **Negative:** Ecosystem is smaller — fewer off-the-shelf middleware components.

---

## ADR-003: Embedded Candle Classifier (Layer 2)

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

For minimal deployments (edge, VPS, air-gapped), requiring an external sidecar (llama.cpp, Ollama, TGI) adds operational complexity. Many classification tasks can be handled by a 2B parameter model on CPU.

### Decision

Embed a **Gemma-2-2B-IT** GGUF model directly in the Rust process using the [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) framework. The model is loaded on first start via `hf-hub` (auto-downloaded from Hugging Face) and wrapped in a `tokio::sync::Mutex` for thread-safe inference on `spawn_blocking`.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Zero external dependencies for Layer 2 classification — a single binary handles everything.
- **Positive:** No HTTP overhead for classification calls; inference is an in-process function call.
- **Positive:** Works in air-gapped environments with pre-cached models.
- **Negative:** ~1.5 GB memory overhead for the Q4_K_M model weights.
- **Negative:** CPU inference is slower than GPU (50–200 ms classification, 200–2000 ms generation).
- **Negative:** `Mutex` serialises inference calls — throughput limited to one inference at a time.
- **Trade-off:** For higher throughput, upgrade to Level 2 (llama.cpp sidecar on GPU).

## ADR-004: Three Deployment Tiers

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

Isartor targets a wide range of deployments, from a developer's laptop to enterprise Kubernetes clusters. A single deployment model cannot serve all use cases optimally.

### Decision

Define three explicit deployment tiers that share the **same binary and configuration surface**:

| Tier | Strategy | Target |
|:-----|:---------|:-------|
| **Level 1** | Monolithic binary, embedded candle | VPS, edge, bare metal |
| **Level 2** | Firewall + llama.cpp sidecars | Docker Compose, single host + GPU |
| **Level 3** | Stateless pods + inference pools | Kubernetes, Helm, HPA |

The tier is selected purely by environment variables and infrastructure, not by code changes.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** A single codebase and binary serves all deployment scenarios.
- **Positive:** Users start at Level 1 and upgrade incrementally — no migrations.
- **Positive:** Clear documentation entry points for each tier.
- **Negative:** Some config variables are irrelevant at certain tiers (e.g., `ISARTOR__LAYER2__SIDECAR_URL` is unused at Level 1 with embedded candle).
- **Negative:** Testing all three tiers requires different infrastructure setups.

---

## ADR-005: llama.cpp as Sidecar (Level 2) Instead of Ollama

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

The original design used [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (~1.5 GB image) as the local SLM engine. While Ollama has a convenient API and model management, it's heavyweight for a sidecar.

### Decision

Replace Ollama with **llama.cpp server** (`ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server`, ~30 MB) as the default sidecar in `docker-compose.sidecar.yml`. Two instances run side by side:

- **slm-generation** (port 8081) — Phi-3-mini for classification and generation
- **slm-embedding** (port 8082) — all-MiniLM-L6-v2 with `--embedding` flag

### Consequences

- **Positive:** 50× smaller container images (30 MB vs. 1.5 GB).
- **Positive:** Faster cold starts; no model pull step needed (uses `--hf-repo` auto-download).
- **Positive:** OpenAI-compatible API — firewall code doesn't need to change.
- **Negative:** Ollama's model management UX (pull, list, delete) is lost.
- **Negative:** Each model needs its own llama.cpp instance (no multi-model serving).
- **Migration:** Ollama-based Compose files (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.azure.yml`) are retained for backward compatibility.
- **Update (ADR-011):** The **slm-embedding** sidecar (port 8082) is now **optional**. Layer 1 semantic cache embeddings are generated in-process via candle (pure-Rust BertModel).

## ADR-006: rig-core for Multi-Provider LLM Client

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

Layer 3 must route to multiple cloud LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI). Implementing each provider's API client from scratch would be error-prone and hard to maintain.

### Decision

Use [rig-core](https://crates.io/crates/rig-core) (v0.32.0) as the unified LLM client. Rig provides a consistent `CompletionModel` abstraction over all supported providers.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Single configuration surface (`ISARTOR__LLM_PROVIDER` + `ISARTOR__EXTERNAL_LLM_API_KEY`) switches providers.
- **Positive:** Provider-specific quirks (Azure deployment IDs, Anthropic versioning) handled by rig.
- **Negative:** Adds a dependency; rig's release cadence may not match our needs.
- **Negative:** Limited to providers rig supports (but covers all major ones).

---

## ADR-007: AIMD Adaptive Concurrency Control

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

A fixed concurrency limit either over-provisions (wasting resources) or under-provisions (rejecting requests during traffic spikes). The firewall needs to dynamically adjust its limit based on real-time latency.

### Decision

Implement an **Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD)** concurrency limiter at Layer 0:

- If P95 latency < target → `limit += 1` (additive increase).
- If P95 latency > target → `limit *= 0.5` (multiplicative decrease).
- Bounded by configurable min/max concurrency limits.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Self-tuning: the limit converges to the optimal value for the current load.
- **Positive:** Protects downstream services (sidecars, cloud LLMs) from overload.
- **Negative:** During cold start, the limit starts low and ramps up — initial requests may see 503s.
- **Tuning:** Target latency must be calibrated per deployment tier.

---

## ADR-008: Unified API Surface

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Superseded

### Context

The original design maintained two API versions: a v1 middleware-based pipeline (`/api/chat`) and a v2 orchestrator-based pipeline (`/api/v2/chat`). Maintaining two code paths increased complexity with no clear benefit once the middleware pipeline matured.

### Decision

Consolidate into a single endpoint:

- **`/api/chat`** — Middleware-based pipeline. Each layer is an Axum middleware (auth → cache → SLM triage → handler).
- The v2 endpoint (`/api/v2/chat`) and its `pipeline_*` configuration fields have been removed.
- Orchestrator and trait-based pipeline components remain in `src/pipeline/` for potential future reintegration.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Single code path to maintain, test, and observe.
- **Positive:** Simplified configuration surface — no more `PIPELINE_*` env vars.
- **Positive:** Eliminates user confusion about which endpoint to use.
- **Negative:** Orchestrator-based features (structured `processing_log`, explicit `PipelineContext`) are not exposed until reintegrated.

---

## ADR-009: Distroless Container Image

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

The firewall binary is statically linked (musl). The runtime container only needs to execute a single binary.

### Decision

Use `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12` as the runtime base image. It contains no shell, no package manager, no libc — only the static binary.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Minimal attack surface — no shell to exec into, no tools for attackers.
- **Positive:** Tiny image size (base ~2 MB + binary ~5 MB = ~7 MB total).
- **Positive:** Passes most container security scanners with zero CVEs.
- **Negative:** Cannot `docker exec` into the container for debugging (no shell).
- **Negative:** Cannot install additional tools at runtime.
- **Workaround:** Use `docker logs`, Jaeger traces, and Prometheus metrics for debugging.

---

## ADR-010: OpenTelemetry for Observability

**Date:** 2024 · **Status:** Accepted

### Context

The firewall needs distributed tracing and metrics. Vendor-specific SDKs (Datadog, New Relic, etc.) create lock-in.

### Decision

Use **OpenTelemetry** (OTLP gRPC) as the sole telemetry interface. Traces and metrics are exported to an OTel Collector, which can forward to any backend (Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.).

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Vendor-neutral — switch backends by reconfiguring the collector, not the app.
- **Positive:** OTLP is a CNCF standard with wide ecosystem support.
- **Positive:** When `ISARTOR__ENABLE_MONITORING=false`, no OTel SDK is initialised — zero overhead.
- **Negative:** Requires an OTel Collector as middleware (adds one more service in Level 2/3).
- **Negative:** Auto-instrumentation is less mature in Rust than in Java/Python.

## ADR-011: Pure-Rust Candle for In-Process Sentence Embeddings

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Status** | Accepted (superseded: fastembed → candle) |
| **Date** | 2025-06 (updated 2025-07) |
| **Deciders** | Core team |
| **Relates to** | ADR-003 (Embedded Candle), ADR-005 (llama.cpp sidecar) |

### Context

Layer 1 (semantic cache) must generate sentence embeddings for every incoming prompt to compute cosine similarity against the vector cache. Previously, this was done via **fastembed** (ONNX Runtime, BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5), which introduced a C++ dependency (onnxruntime-sys) that broke cross-compilation on ARM64 macOS and complicated the build matrix.

### Decision

Use **candle** (`candle-core`, `candle-nn`, `candle-transformers` 0.9) with **hf-hub** and **tokenizers** to run **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2** in-process via a pure-Rust `BertModel`. The model weights (~90 MB) are downloaded once from Hugging Face Hub on first startup and cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/`. Inference is invoked through `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` since BERT forward passes are CPU-bound.

- **Model:** sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 — 384-dimensional embeddings, optimised for sentence similarity.
- **Runtime:** Pure-Rust candle stack — zero C/C++ dependencies, seamless cross-compilation to any `rustc` target.
- **Pooling:** Mean pooling with attention mask, followed by L2 normalisation.
- **Thread safety:** The inner `BertModel` is wrapped in `std::sync::Mutex` because `forward()` takes `&mut self`. This is acceptable because inference is always called from `spawn_blocking`, never holding the lock across `.await` points.
- **Architecture:** `TextEmbedder` is initialised once at startup, stored as `Arc<TextEmbedder>` in `AppState`, and injected into the cache middleware.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|:------------|:-------------|
| fastembed (ONNX Runtime) | C++ dependency (onnxruntime-sys) breaks ARM64 cross-compilation; ~5 MB shared library |
| llama.cpp sidecar (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | Network round-trip on hot path, extra container to manage |
| sentence-transformers (Python) | Crosses FFI boundary, adds Python runtime dependency |
| ort (raw ONNX Runtime bindings) | Same C++ dependency problem as fastembed |

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Eliminates ~2–5 ms network latency per embedding call on the cache hot path.
- **Positive:** Zero C/C++ dependencies — `cargo build` works on any platform without cmake or pre-built binaries.
- **Positive:** Zero sidecar dependency for Level 1 — the minimal Dockerfile runs self-contained.
- **Positive:** Model weights are auto-downloaded from Hugging Face Hub; reproducible builds.
- **Negative:** First startup downloads model weights (~90 MB) if not pre-cached.
- **Negative:** `Mutex` serialises concurrent embedding calls within a single process (acceptable at current scale; can be replaced with a pool of models if needed).

## ADR-012: Pluggable Trait Provider (Hexagonal Architecture)

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2025-06 |
| **Deciders** | Core team |
| **Relates to** | ADR-003 (Embedded Candle), ADR-004 (Three Deployment Tiers) |

### Context

As Isartor grew from a single-process binary (Level 1) to a multi-tier deployment (Level 1 → 2 → 3), the cache and SLM router components became tightly coupled to their in-process implementations. Scaling to Level 3 (Kubernetes, multiple replicas) requires:

1. **Shared cache** — in-process LRU caches are isolated per pod; cache hits are inconsistent, duplicating work.
2. **GPU-backed inference** — in-process Candle inference is CPU-bound; Level 3 needs a dedicated GPU inference pool (vLLM / TGI) that can scale independently.

Hard-coding these choices into the firewall binary would require compile-time feature flags or code branching, making the binary non-portable across tiers.

### Decision

Adopt the **Ports & Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture)** pattern:

- **Ports** (`src/core/ports.rs`) — Define `ExactCache` and `SlmRouter` as `async_trait` traits (`Send + Sync`), representing the interfaces the firewall depends on.
- **Adapters** (`src/adapters/`) — Provide concrete implementations:
  - `InMemoryCache` (ahash + LRU + parking_lot) and `RedisExactCache` for `ExactCache`
  - `EmbeddedCandleRouter` and `RemoteVllmRouter` for `SlmRouter`
- **Factory** (`src/factory.rs`) — `build_exact_cache(&config)` and `build_slm_router(&config, &http_client)` read `AppConfig.cache_backend` and `AppConfig.router_backend` at startup and return the appropriate `Box<dyn Trait>`.
- **Configuration** (`src/config.rs`) — `CacheBackend` enum (`Memory | Redis`) and `RouterBackend` enum (`Embedded | Vllm`) with associated connection URLs, selectable via `ISARTOR__CACHE_BACKEND` and `ISARTOR__ROUTER_BACKEND` env vars.

The **same binary** serves all three deployment tiers; the runtime behaviour is entirely configuration-driven.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|:------------|:-------------|
| Compile-time feature flags (`#[cfg(feature = "redis")]`) | Produces different binaries per tier; complicates CI and container builds |
| Service mesh sidecar (Envoy filter for caching) | Adds infrastructure complexity; cache logic is domain-specific |
| Plugin system (dynamic `.so` loading) | Over-engineered; `dyn Trait` with compile-time-known variants is simpler |
| Runtime scripting (Lua / Wasm policy) | Unnecessary indirection; Rust trait dispatch is zero-cost |

### Consequences

- **Positive:** One binary, all tiers — only env vars change between Level 1 (embedded everything) and Level 3 (Redis + vLLM).
- **Positive:** Horizontal scalability — with `cache_backend=redis`, all pods share the same cache; with `router_backend=vllm`, GPU inference scales independently.
- **Positive:** Testability — unit tests inject mock adapters via the trait interface.
- **Positive:** Extensibility — adding a new backend (e.g., Memcached, Triton) requires only a new adapter implementing the trait.
- **Negative:** Minor runtime overhead from `dyn Trait` dynamic dispatch (single vtable lookup per call — negligible vs. network I/O).
- **Negative:** `EmbeddedCandleRouter` remains a skeleton; full candle-based classification requires the `embedded-inference` feature flag to be completed.

## ADR-013: Resolve Model Aliases Before Routing and Cache Key Generation

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-03 |
| **Deciders** | Core team |
| **Relates to** | ADR-001 (Deflection Stack), ADR-006 (rig-core), ADR-012 (Hexagonal Architecture) |

### Context

Users increasingly connect heterogeneous tools and SDKs to Isartor, but raw provider model IDs are verbose and change over time. Operators want stable names such as `fast`, `smart`, or `code` without fragmenting cache behavior or forcing every client to know the real provider model identifier.

### Decision

Add a `model_aliases` configuration map in `AppConfig` and resolve aliases at the HTTP boundary before:

- request routing to Layer 3
- exact-cache key generation
- semantic-cache input generation
- OpenAI-compatible `GET /v1/models` discovery output

Aliases currently resolve within the already-configured provider. They do not yet switch providers; multi-provider named routing remains a follow-on roadmap item.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Clients can use stable, human-friendly model names without changing provider-specific IDs everywhere.
- **Positive:** Alias traffic and canonical model traffic share the same cache behavior because cache inputs are normalized first.
- **Positive:** `GET /v1/models` can advertise both real model IDs and operator-defined aliases.
- **Negative:** This introduces another routing indirection layer that operators must document clearly.
- **Negative:** Provider switching by alias is intentionally out of scope for this ADR and remains future work.

---

## ADR-014: Keep Request/Response Debug Logging Separate from Telemetry

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-03 |
| **Deciders** | Core team |
| **Relates to** | ADR-001 (Deflection Stack), ADR-010 (OpenTelemetry for Observability) |

### Context

Operators sometimes need to inspect the exact request and response payloads Isartor handled when debugging provider integrations, auth failures, or client compatibility issues. Existing OpenTelemetry spans record request metadata and routing outcomes, but intentionally do not include raw bodies because prompts often contain sensitive data and large payloads.

### Decision

Add a separate, opt-in request logging mode controlled by:

- `enable_request_logs = true|false`
- `request_log_path = "~/.isartor/request_logs"`

When enabled, the outer monitoring middleware writes one JSONL record per request/response exchange to rotating files under `request_log_path`. Sensitive headers such as `Authorization`, `api-key`, and `x-api-key` are redacted automatically, and body logging stays out of the normal `isartor.log` / OpenTelemetry stream. The CLI exposes these logs via `isartor logs --requests`.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Troubleshooting provider and client integration issues becomes much faster because operators can inspect exact payloads.
- **Positive:** Normal operational logs and telemetry remain privacy-safer by default because body logging is opt-in and stored separately.
- **Positive:** The `logs` CLI can tail request debug logs without mixing them into startup/runtime logs.
- **Negative:** Even with redaction, request logs can contain sensitive prompt content, so access controls and retention need operator attention.
- **Negative:** Request logging adds some I/O overhead when enabled and should not be the default steady-state mode.

## ADR-015: Treat Additional OpenAI-Compatible Vendors as Registry Entries, Not Unique Protocols

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-03 |
| **Deciders** | Core team |
| **Relates to** | ADR-006 (rig-core for Multi-Provider LLM Client), ADR-013 (Resolve Model Aliases Before Routing and Cache Key Generation) |

### Context

More providers now expose OpenAI-compatible chat-completions APIs. Adding each of them as a bespoke protocol integration would create repetitive code across configuration, runtime routing, setup flows, and connectivity checks even when the wire format is effectively the same.

### Decision

Add new vendors such as Cerebras, Nebius, SiliconFlow, Fireworks, NVIDIA, and Chutes as named entries in Isartor's provider registry with:

- a stable `llm_provider` enum variant
- a default OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- default model suggestions for CLI/setup
- connectivity checks that probe each vendor's model-list endpoint
- runtime Layer 3 routing that reuses the OpenAI-compatible Rig client with a provider-specific base URL

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Users get first-class provider names in `set-key`, `setup`, and `check` without manually discovering endpoints.
- **Positive:** Runtime behavior stays simple because OpenAI-compatible providers share one implementation path where practical.
- **Positive:** Future provider additions become mostly registry work instead of bespoke transport work.
- **Negative:** Operators may assume every provider has identical semantics just because the protocol is OpenAI-compatible; model naming and auth policies still vary by vendor.

## ADR-016: Keep Provider Health Status In-Memory and Expose It Through Debug/CLI Views

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-03 |
| **Deciders** | Core team |
| **Relates to** | ADR-001 (Deflection Stack), ADR-010 (OpenTelemetry for Observability), ADR-015 (OpenAI-Compatible Provider Registry) |

### Context

Operators need a fast way to confirm which Layer 3 provider Isartor is using right now and whether recent upstream requests have been succeeding or failing. Existing `isartor check` output is a point-in-time connectivity probe, while prompt/agent stats focus on traffic history rather than the currently configured provider's health state.

### Decision

Track provider health in memory on `AppState` for the active provider only. The tracker records:

- configured provider name, model, and effective endpoint summary
- whether an API key / endpoint is configured
- request count and error count
- last-known success timestamp
- last-known error timestamp and compact error message

Expose that snapshot through two surfaces:

- authenticated `GET /debug/providers`
- `isartor providers` CLI output (with local-config fallback when the endpoint is unavailable)

The tracker is updated by real Layer 3 request outcomes and resets when the process restarts. It is not persisted to Redis, telemetry backends, or disk.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Operators get a fast "what provider is active and is it healthy?" answer without tailing logs.
- **Positive:** The health view stays tightly aligned with the running process because it is updated directly from Layer 3 success/failure paths.
- **Positive:** Debug output remains lightweight and privacy-safer than request-body logging because it stores compact status metadata only.
- **Negative:** Health state is process-local, so multi-replica deployments must query each instance (or aggregate externally) if they want a fleet-wide view.
- **Negative:** Restarting Isartor clears the counters and timestamps by design.
