and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.25] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `isartor stats` for user-facing prompt totals, per-layer counts, and recent prompt routing history
- Unified prompt visibility rollups across gateway and CONNECT proxy traffic via `/debug/stats/prompts`

### Changed
- `/health` now includes prompt totals so operators can quickly confirm how much prompt traffic Isartor has seen
- Observability docs and metrics examples now cover proxy-aware prompt telemetry dimensions such as `traffic_surface`, `client`, and `endpoint_family`

## [0.1.24] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- `isartor update` now bypasses stale local Isartor proxy environment when checking GitHub for releases, so updates still work after the local CONNECT proxy on `localhost:8081` has been stopped

## [0.1.23] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Proxy-layer visibility for recent CONNECT-routed client requests through logs, `/debug/proxy/recent`, `/health`, and `isartor connect status`
- Repo-specific `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for future Copilot sessions

### Changed
- CONNECT proxy Layer 3 now preserves the native upstream for Copilot, Claude Code, and Antigravity instead of requiring a separately configured Isartor Layer 3 provider key for those proxied paths
- `isartor connect claude` and `isartor connect antigravity` now configure proxy-based routing with local CA trust so native client authentication can continue upstream
- Integration docs now describe multi-client CONNECT proxy behavior and supported intercepted upstream domains

## [0.1.22] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Windows x86_64 build target in release pipeline
- SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CODEOWNERS
- Dependabot for Cargo, Actions, and Docker updates
- Dynamic version badge from GitHub Releases

### Changed
- All install URLs now point to `isartor-ai/Isartor` (no more `isartor-dist` indirection)
- Consolidated architecture docs into single `docs/2-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Cleaned release notes template (removed private-repo install paths)

### Removed
- `dist_release.yml` workflow (isartor-dist no longer needed)
- Duplicate `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install.ps1`
- Private-repo install instructions from README and docs
- `azure_openai_key/` directory
- Stale `architecture.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` duplicates

## [0.1.18] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- HTTP CONNECT proxy with TLS MITM for GitHub Copilot CLI (`isartor connect copilot`)
- Proxy listens on `:8081` by default (`ISARTOR__PROXY_PORT`)
- Auto-generated CA stored at `~/.isartor/ca/`
- Per-host server certificates via rcgen
- Domain allowlist for transparent tunneling

## [0.1.17] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- `isartor set-key` CLI subcommand for configuring LLM provider API keys
- Supports OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral providers
- Interactive secure input via rpassword
- TOML config merge via toml_edit
- `--env-file` mode for Docker secret workflows
- `--dry-run` flag for previewing changes

## [0.1.16] - 2025-07-13

### Added
- Publish releases to distribution repo via `dist_release.yml`

### Fixed
- Linux musl builds now use cargo-zigbuild for static linking

## [0.1.15] - 2025-07-13

### Fixed
- Build musl targets with runner-based zigbuild (no Docker container)
